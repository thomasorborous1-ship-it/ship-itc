   frame so that subsequent gsKit primitives draw to the right buffer
   at the right position.

   Why FRAME_1: the SNES per-scanline blender steers FRAME_1 to its
   render-to-texture target every frame and only restores it through
   the legacy gpfifo chain, which is dispatched *after* gsKit's queue.

   Why XYOFFSET_1: the blender overwrites XYOFFSET_1 on every scanline
   with (0x8000, 0x8000 - iLine*16). Its restore also goes through
   the gpfifo chain, so any gsKit prim queued before gpfifo dispatch
   draws with the blender's stale offset — shifting the sprite
   hundreds of pixels off-screen (the frozen-menu symptom). */

   is the same byte address with bit 29 set: the EE bus reads/writes
   bypass the data cache, so a peripheral DMA reading the same physical
   line sees stores immediately without a FlushCache.

   Used (or about to be used) by the SNES blender when it patches
   per-scanline parameters into a chain that the GIF DMA is about to
   read. The legacy gslist path achieves the same with
   GSListGetUncachedPtr; this helper is the gsKit-side equivalent that
   does not depend on a gslist context. Returns the input pointer
   unchanged (with an assert in CODE_DEBUG builds) if the address is
   already uncached or otherwise outside physical RAM.
